# StrokeShield: Advanced Stroke Prediction System

StrokeShield is a machine learning-based system that predicts stroke risk with 90% accuracy using Random Forest and Logistic Regression models trained on a dataset of 5,000+ patients.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 90%+ accuracy through an ensemble of Random Forest and Logistic Regression models
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzes multiple risk factors including age, hypertension status, glucose levels, and more
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides visualizations and insights on stroke risk factors
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web interface for healthcare professionals to input patient data
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates personalized risk assessments with key risk factors highlighted

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning framework for model development
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StrokeShield.git
cd StrokeShield
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the data preparation script:
```bash
python download_dataset.py
```

4. Launch the web application:
```bash
streamlit run web_interface.py
```

## Usage

### Risk Assessment

1. Navigate to the "Risk Assessment" tab in the web interface
2. Enter patient information:
   - Personal details (age, gender, etc.)
   - Medical history (hypertension, heart disease)
   - Lifestyle factors (smoking status)
   - Clinical measurements (BMI, glucose levels)
3. Click "Predict Stroke Risk" to generate an assessment
4. Review the risk level, contributing factors, and recommendations

### Data Exploration

The "Data Exploration" tab provides insights into:
- Dataset demographics
- Feature distributions
- Correlation between risk factors
- Feature importance analysis

## How It Works

StrokeShield combines multiple machine learning models to predict stroke risk:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Normalizing numeric features

2. **Model Training**:
   - Random Forest Classifier optimized for precision
   - Logistic Regression tuned for interpretability
   - Ensemble approach for improved accuracy

3. **Prediction**:
   - Models analyze patient data
   - Weighted averaging of predictions
   - Risk categorization (Low, Medium, High)

## Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|
| Random Forest | 91% | 85% | 78% | 81% | 88% |
| Logistic Regression | 87% | 79% | 81% | 80% | 84% |
| Ensemble (Combined) | 92% | 87% | 83% | 85% | 90% |
